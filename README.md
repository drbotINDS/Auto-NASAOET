# Auto-NASAOET
Auto-NASAOET stands for automatic regresssion-Multi Objective Optimization with NASGA-II-AHP or Entropy-TOPSIS. this tool is applied for designing shading system for buildings in hot climate regions. It can also be used for design archiectural elements that includes many design variables and objectives. This approach is coded within MATLAB environmrnt with a simple interactive Interface for ease of application.
