# MOAOET
MOAOET stands for Multi Objective Optimization-AHP or Entropy-TOPSIS. It is an approach used in architecultural applications where it is needed to design any architecultural element.
Where the design process involves involoves a lot of design variables and objectives.
Whith the following link, you can acess MOAOET with MATLAB online and test the algorithm. Also, you can use it to solve your own problem.
